## Qbics-Molstar

A web-based viewer which can be used [online](https://molstar.szbl.ac.cn/viewer/) or [locally](https://molstar.szbl.ac.cn/download/).

One can view orbitals with the `fch` file produced by MOKIT, following the [instructions (Chinese)](https://molstar.szbl.ac.cn/docs/tutorial/wave-function/).
Other file formats, like `mkl` or `molden` can also be used in principle.
